        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This is an easy grilled peach dessert! I use a honey nut flavored cream cheese spread and it's wonderful! Drizzle a little extra honey after they're grilled and they're perfect! 
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 peaches, halved and pitted</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons clover honey</li>
                <li>1 cup soft cream cheese with honey and nuts</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a grill for medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Brush peaches with a light coating of oil. Place pit side down onto the grill. Grill for 5 minutes, or until the surfaces have nice grill marks. Turn the peaches over, and drizzle with a bit of honey. Place a dollop of the cream cheese spread in the place where the pit was. Grill for 2 to 3 more minutes, or until the filling is warm. Serve immediately.</li>
